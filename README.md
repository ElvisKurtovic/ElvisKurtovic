### Hi there 👋 I'm Elvis



- 🔭 I’m currently working on being the best future junior developer anyone could be.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, html, css, and much more through Boise CodeWorks.
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I can sometimes seem a little intimidating to approach but that's just one of the few drawbacks of being a Capricorn 😄.

- ⚡ Fun Facts: I was born in Bosnia and lived in Germany for 6 years. After my time in Germany, my family and I imigrated to the US in the late 90's. I love seeing others happy and succeeding. You have pictures of your animals and are wondering if I'd love to see them? The answer is absolutely YES, show them all to me!
