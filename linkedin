When I first started down the path of software development, I found it nearly impossible to find an up to date resource I could utilize to help with explanation of languages and syntax. What resource would you recommend to an aspiring full stack developer?
Donniqtay Campbell, Sawyer Pearson, Zack Deines
Jake Overall, Tim Dohmen, Mark Ohnsman, Harrison Wheeler, Michael A. Jones, Brian Peck, Yung Thuy-Dung Stiffler, Christian Coonce, Darryl Kilzer Jr, Jordan Speer
